Fire From The Booth.
This is my Portfolio Site. The title is a pun on my name, some slang and a popular radio/youtube show that showcases the talent on the rap/grime/Hip-Hop Scene.

I Designed it myself using figma : https://www.figma.com/file/zIBuCztelBzlQ9rHRsEil9/fire-from-the-booth?node-id=0%3A1

Then built it using React to test my component building skills along with react routing, Javascript, CSS and Semantic HTML understanding.

It is Curenntly in creation but watch this space for the fully deployed big baller site, coming to a screen near you when I can figure out how to centre this div!!
